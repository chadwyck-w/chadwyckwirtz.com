          Better Body is a personalized, guided 8-week program to help you reduce body fat. It provides you personalized daily lifestyle tips to help you reach a healthier body composition. 
        </h6><h6>
          Unlike other programs, Better Body focuses directly on body fat, filtering out variables such as person's overall size, water weight, and other factors that frequently frustrate people trying to lose weight. People who target an optimal level of body fat instead of an "ideal weight" are more likely to incrementally sustain their weight loss over time.
        </h6><h6>
          This program was created following the release of the Sleep Smarter program for the Nokia Health Mate application.  Health Mate is the companion app to the Nokia family of smart health devices.  Sleep smarter and Better Body are mobile web apps that are accessed from the Health Mate app using a webview.  The intention of this system design is to allow for the creation of plug in programs that can be updated without asking the user to update Health Mate in the app store.
        </h6><h6>
          I joined this project at the onset to help fill in for the lack of time and engineering resources.  My first task was to take the newly created user experience design and the previous projects implementation and find what could be transferred to the new project.  
        </h6><h6>
          The interaction design of Better Body is almost entirely driven by full screen animation.  I found that we could reuse Ionic framework for this new project as it has many of the features that the UX would depend on already built in.  
        </h6><h6>
          One of the more challenging components of the app to develop was the compound swiping and animation UX.  The animations are principally full screen and high fidelity, synchronized between swipes and the interaction must be fully responsive on older iPhones and Android hardware.  The content is dynamically loaded and presented from an application server and the app must be able to support a multitude of different compound presentations.
        </h6><h6>
          Our solution involved creating a high performance custom Ionic component to handle this compound animation and interaction in addition to performance testing the catalog of supported devices.</h6>
