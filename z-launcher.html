          At the time, the status quo for system UI application picking was essentially static.  A devices home screen would contain a grid of icons representing the applications installed on the device and these icons would be placed automatically by temporal order, users direction or some other static means.  A user would access an application by accessing the home screen, finding their app and tapping it to launch.  This simple process could become frustrating if the user had not memorized the place of the UI on the home screen.
        </h6>
        <h6>
          Instead of a keyboard, our design would use stroke input and over time intelligently develop a corpus of intentions.  The entire screen would act a canvas for stroke input and UI at the same time.  The home screen would react to the stroke by displaying the most like intended actions for the user.  At the top of the list the user should see what they want, if not the top the second or third item and so forth.  The user could tap the action they want to perform or stroke another character to narrow the results. Over time the users personal behavior would reflect in the displayed results to the point where it felt like the device could read their mind.
        </h6>

          We developed an open feedback system for users and one of the most widely requested features was Android widgets.  There was a long drawn out contest between our team and Nokia design on the principles of letting the user customize the home screen UI in this way. While the final decision to allow widgets was hotly contested, user feedback took priority. Our measurable goal was user growth and retention.

          I was closely involved in the design and implementation of this product but during a reorganization I was invited to join a team within Nokia design focused on rapid prototyping and and technical design support.  This was an exciting opportunity for me that I believed would more closely align with my interests and skill set.
